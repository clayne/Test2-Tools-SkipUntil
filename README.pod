=head1 NAME

Test2::Tools::SkipUntil - skip tests until a date is reached

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test2::Bundle::More
  use Test2::Tools::SkipUntil;

  SKIP: {
    skip_until "known fail see issue #213", '2018-06-01';
    ...
  }

  ...

  done_testing;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Exports two functions for skipping tests until a datetime is reached. Dates are
evaluated in C<localtime>. These might be useful when you have known exceptions
in your test suite which are temporary.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 skip_until ($why, $count, $datetime)

Skips all tests in a C<SKIP> block, registering C<$count> skipped tests until
C<localtime> is greater than or equal to C<$datetime>. Just like with
L<skip|https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2::Tools::Basic#skip($why)>, C<$count> is
optional, and defaults to 1.

C<$datetime> must be a scalar in one of the following formats:

=over 4

=item *

  YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS - e.g. "2017-05-01T13:24:58"

=item *

  YYYY-MM-DD - e.g. "2017-05-01"

=back

=head2 skip_all_until ($why, $datetime)

Skips all tests by setting the test plan to zero, and exiting succesfully
unless C<localtime> is greater than or equal to C<$datetime>. Behaves like
L<skip_all|https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2::Tools::Basic#skip_all($reason)>.

See the L</"skip_until ($why, $count, $datetime)"> for the accepted C<$datetime> formats.
